I'm just trying to become a web developer at my 38.  
I have a tiny experience of self-styding programming in 2020 and started my excersizes again in september 2021.  
Here i keep links to tutorials that i've learned. It is opportunity to come back to them later if needed.  
Also hope it will be usefull for someone who decide to go the same way.
