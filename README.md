Hello. 
I'm a junior web developer located in Moscow. I had been working as a product photographer for more than 6 years, but decided to change my career and right now looking for the opportunity to start my new career as a web developer. I recently finished a course on Udemy "JS  + React" by Ivan Petrichenko and able to build fully responsive websites and web apps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with Git control. You can find what I've build so far here:

While I understand that I still don't know much, I believe I can be a valuable team player. I'm a very easy learner and a very good problem solver.  Will be digging everywhere until I find a solution.
Thank you for your time and looking forward to hearing from you.
